## Step 1 : Setup

* Download the repository.

* Go to your Drive and create a "IA - Colorize" folder.

* In this folder, import all the folders included in the repository (Data, Checkpoint)


## Step 2 : Running the code

* Go to Google Collaboratory and import the Notebook (.ipynb).

* By default, the training process will be run. If you don't want, you can change the training_process variable to False in the Hyper-Parameters block (number 3).

* Execute all the code.

## Step 3 : Show results

* In the /Dataset/result folder, you will find the resulting images.
